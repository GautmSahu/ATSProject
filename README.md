# ATS (Applicant Tracking System)

## Overview

The **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** is a Django-based web application designed to manage candidate data efficiently. It provides API endpoints to perform CRUD operations on candidate records and supports a powerful search feature that ranks candidates based on relevance.

## Features

### 1. **Candidate Management**

- Add new candidates.
- Retrieve a list of all candidates.
- Update candidate details.
- Delete candidates.

### 2. **Advanced Search**

- Search candidates by name.
- Results are ranked based on exact matches and partial word matches.
- Higher relevance is given to full matches.
- Implements dynamic filtering using Django ORM expressions.

### 3. **Relevancy-Based Sorting**

- Candidates are ranked by **search term match count**.
- Full-name exact matches appear **at the top**.
- Partial matches are ordered based on the number of matched words.

### 4. **Exception Handling & Logging**
- Implemented robust exception handling to ensure API stability.
- Added logging to track application behavior and errors.
- Logs are stored in a structured format for debugging and monitoring.

### 5. **Environment Variables Support**
- Configurations such as database credentials and API keys are managed using .env files.
- Ensures security by keeping sensitive information outside the codebase.
